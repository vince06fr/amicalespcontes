Pinax
------

Pinax is an open-source platform built on the Django Web Framework. It is an ecosystem of reusable Django apps, themes, and starter project templates. 
This collection can be found at http://pinaxproject.com.

This app was developed as part of the Pinax ecosystem but is just a Django app and can be used independently of other Pinax apps.


pinax-calendars-demo
---------------------

`pinax-calendars-demo` is a demo project to show how the [pinax-calendars](https://github.com/pinax/pinax-calendars) app works.


Getting Started
---------------

Make sure you are using a virtual environment of some sort (e.g. `virtualenv` or
`pyenv`).

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
./manage.py migrate
./manage.py loaddata sites
./manage.py runserver
```


Documentation
----------------

The Pinax documentation is available at http://pinaxproject.com/pinax/. The `pinax-calendars-demo` documentation is currently under construction. If you would like to help us improve our documentation or write more documentation, please join our Pinax Project Slack team and let us know!

In case of any questions, we would recommend for you to join our [Pinax Slack team](http://slack.pinaxproject.com) and ping us there instead of creating an issue on GitHub. Creating issues on GitHub is of course also valid but we are usually able to help you faster if you ping us in Slack.

We would also highly recommend for your to read our [Open Source and Self-Care blog post](http://blog.pinaxproject.com/2016/01/19/open-source-and-self-care/).  


Code of Conduct

In order to foster a kind, inclusive, and harassment-free community, the Pinax Project has a code of conduct, which can be found [here](http://pinaxproject.com/pinax/code_of_conduct/). 
We'd like to ask you to treat everyone as a smart human programmer that shares an interest in Python, Django, and Pinax with you.
